School Practice Questions (Java)

**School**: City Montessori School (CMS) - Gomti Nagar 1 Branch, Lucknow
**Grade**: IX

I will keep on updating the repository with Java programs, sometimes with a twist of my own and some of my great friends like @abhisheksaxena11jul and more!

This can serve you before exams, or just for practice. If you find any worthy programs for this repo, just head up to the Pull Requests section and make one! We are inclusive, as always, and who doesn't like some mind games to kill your time? (IK about the dark side of programming - debugging all day, that's fine, let's be optimists).
